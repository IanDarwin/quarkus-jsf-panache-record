= quarkus-jsf-panache-record

Simple demo whose full name should be
_Quarkus for web app with JSF and Primefaces, using Hibernate and Panache for database, and using Panache "Active Record" style blended with JSF/CDI managed bean_.
But that title's too long for a repo, so it is (called) what it is.

Just use the `run` script, or do `mvn quarkus:dev` then visit http://localhost:8440/[].

== TODO

Add PF Message component (to both, using template?).
